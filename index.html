        <p>In the game, <a href= https://www.escapefromtarkov.com>Escape From Tarkov</a>, you play as a PMC in either two factions, <strong>USEC</strong> or <strong>BEAR</strong>. You enter a raid, either with friends or alone.
        Before you do, you find that you have a storage system where you can take items with you and gear up to prepare yourself for the raid. Inside the raid, you can encounter other PMCs who are real players, scavengers and ex-PMC raiders which are AI. By chance, you may also encounter bosses who are more
        difficult to fight in terms of their strategy, accuracy, and reaction. Some of these bosses are alone or accompanied by guards. By fighting other players, AI, or bosses, you can take their valuable loot by storing them inside your backpack. You can also loot containers from
        the environment around you. When you are satisified with the loot you have, you have to <strong>extract</strong>. Depending where you spawned in the map, you have different extraction points to take on the opposite side of the map. Extracting will allow you keep the items you looted
        by storing it within your stash. However, if you die in a raid, you will lose <strong>everything</strong> you brought with you, making the game <strong>hardcore</strong>. You can insure your items before a raid, and if nobody takes your insured item when you die, then you
        will receive it back from the trader you insured within a few days. The game is a <strong>military simulator</strong>, so it simulates ballistics and bullet physics like in <strong>real life</strong>. Gun aiming will be strange and challenging until you get used to it. 
        Healing your character involves animations such as applying a tourniquet, taking pain relievers, and utilizing first aid items, which makes the experience incredibly <strong>immersive</strong>. There is a lot more to this game and learning it will be an experience unlike any other.</p>
